# React mememaker

Who doesn't love having a good laugh with memes, right?!
This is a simple React project that allows you to create some memes and explore your humorous creativity.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- **src/Pages**: Contains the React components of the application.
- **src/index.js**: The entry point of the application.
- **src/app.js**: layer where components are rendered and surrounded by context
- **src/styles**: Contains the application's global styles
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **package.json**: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- **README.md**: The file you're currently reading.


## How it Works

This example demonstrates a simple counter application using the Context API. The `MyContext.js` file defines the context and provides the `count` state and an `increment()` function to its child components.

The `App.js` component renders `ComponentA` and `ComponentB` components. Both components consume the `count` state from the context and display it. When the user clicks the "Increment" button in `ComponentA`, it calls the `increment()` function from the context, which updates the count and triggers a re-render in both components.

## Stack used
