# React mememaker

Who doesn't love having a good laugh with memes, right?!
This is a simple React project that allows you to create some memes and explore your humorous creativity.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- **src/Pages**: Contains the React components of the application.
- **src/index.js**: The entry point of the application.
- **src/app.js**: layer where components are rendered and surrounded by context
- **src/styles**: Contains the application's global styles
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **package.json**: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- **README.md**: The file you're currently reading.


## How it Works

Through the imgflip api, you make a request for the meme templates, after that you can add the text fields that the templates will allow and after that just click to generate and your meme will be ready
## Stack used
